    <h3>Bay of Bahia</h3>
    <p>
      Nestled on the northern end of the Isle of Caludge, this beach is cited
      as the most popular getaway for vacationers during peak summer months.
      Popular activities include scuba diving, snorkeling, and bird watching.

    <h3>Selange Beach</h3>
    <p>
      Selange Beach is known for its temperate sand. Made up of ground coral
      due to thousands of years of tectonic activity, the sand is always cool
      to the touch, despite the heat. The western portion includes fantastic
      flora and fauna and many pre-Columbian ruins.

    <h3>Hunt Lagoon</h3>
    <p>
      Known primarily for it's hidden location on Kamar Island (which includes
      swimming through an underground cave), Hunt Lagoon offers a peaceful
      respite from the tourist-laden locations found throughout Kamar. If
      possible, make a visit at night – it's bioluminescent lagoon is like
      viewing fireworks in the water!

    <h3>Moat Lagoon</h3>
    <p>
      Last, but certainly not least, is Moat Lagoon. This is one of the most
      difficult beach locations to access. The lagoon is located inside of a
      prehistoric cenote, or underground aquifer. Accessing it involves
      crossing the moat surrounding the lagoon (hence the name) with locals by
      kayak. Once there, marvel at the phenomenal (and endangered) quetzal bird
      and its golden feathers.
