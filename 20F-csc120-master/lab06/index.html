<h1>CSC 120 Lab 6</h1>
</center>
</font>
<p>In this lab we will make a Java Application that instantiates
several objects from a RoundHead class,
and provides buttons to control the RoundHeads. We will:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use Boolean conditions and <code>if</code> statements.</li>
  <li>Use Buttons and ActionListeners.</li>
  <li>Call methods of one object from methods of another object.</li>
  <li>Add data members and methods to an existing class.</li>
</ul>
	<h2>Part 1: Project Setup</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Create a new NetBeans project called Lab6, and copy the starter source
files to it.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>File | New Project, etc. Make sure the Project Location is in
          your CSC120 folder, and the Project Name is Lab6.<br><br></li>
	  <li>Right-click on the following link and save this .zip file in your CSC120 folder:
	      <blockquote>
		      <a href="Lab6StarterFiles.zip"> Lab6StarterFiles.zip</a>
		  </blockquote></li>
      <li>Use Windows Explorer to Extract All from the .zip file you saved in the previous
          step, and then copy <b><em>All Four</em></b> files that were extracted,
	      and paste them in the src folder of your Lab 6 Netbeans project.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
	  <li><b>Run the program.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the file <b>MUFrame.java</b> and switch to "Source" view; then edit
	  the file so that the comment header
at the top of the file has your name in place of Samantha Student's
	      name and uses today's date.&nbsp;<br> <br></li>
	      <li>Switch to "Design" view and 
right-click on the label in the interface that says "Samantha Student" and edit the
		      text so that your name is used instead of Samantha's.&nbsp; <br><br></li>
	    <li>Change the title of the JFrame for the
		    program so that your name appears instead of Samantha's.&nbsp; <br><br></li>
	    <li>Open the file <b>MUPanel.java</b>
and edit the comment header at the top of the file so that it has your name in place
of Samantha's and uses today&rsquo;s date. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
	    <li>Run the <b>MUFrame.java</b> application. <br><br>
	      <ol type="a">
		      <li>You should see one RoundHead character and
		      one button, but at this time, clicking the button doesn't do anything.&nbsp;<br><br></li> 
	    <li>Samantha Student's
		    name should not appear anywhere in the window or in the window frame.<br><br></li>
		    </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
	
	</ol>
	<h2>Part 2: Study The Code</h2>
	<ol start="3">

  <li><b>Look over the RoundHead class definition.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <b>RoundHead.java</b> file in the NetBeans IDE.&nbsp;
	  Notice the various data properties and the purpose of each.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The constructor expects parameters to initialize some of the
data members, but just sets the size to 30 for every RoundHead that is
constructed.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The draw method should seem understandable, although
	  a bit involved.&nbsp; Notice the use of an <code>if</code>
	  statement.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The moveVertically method, when invoked by some other object,
will change the value of down, so that the next time draw is invoked
the RoundHead will appear in a different position.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Part 3: Revising Code</h2>
<ol start="4">
  <li><b>Get the Move RoundHeads button to work.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>The starter program has been set up with a partially completed
	  <code>moveButtonActionPerformed</code> method for you already.&nbsp; In "Source"
	  view in the <b>MUFrame</b> class, find the 
	  <code><b>moveButtonActionPerformed</b></code>
method definition. &nbsp; <br>
	      <blockquote><em>Note that this method doesn't do anything right now
other than call the <code>repaint</code> method of the <code>muPanel</code>
		      object.</em></blockquote>
	      <li>Inside the <code>
moveButtonActionPerformed</code> method, as the first action to be taken in the
method, add a call to the <code>moveObjects</code> method of the <code>muPanel</code>
object &mdash; this method
accepts NO parameters inside the parentheses of the method call.&nbsp;  <em>Hint, revisit your Lab 5 project
		      if you don't recall how to do this.</em><br>

		      <blockquote><em>Note:&nbsp; you need to keep the <code>repaint</code> method call as the last action in 
			      <code>moveButtonActionPerformed</code>.</em></blockquote>
      </li>
      <li><b>Run the program, test, and fix as needed.</b> &nbsp;Each time
you click the Move RoundHeads button, the RoundHead should move up
until it gets close to the top edge of the viewer, then start moving
down. If you keep clicking until it gets close to the bottom edge of
the viewer, then it should start moving up again.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Add a working Change Mood button to the Program.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li> Use the Designer to add another JButton to the interface: <br>
        <br>
        <ol type="a">
          <li> In "Design" view in the <b>MUFrame</b> class, right-click on
		  the moveButton and choose "Copy" from the pop-up menu.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
		<li>Right click in the Designer window just below the button and choose
		  "Paste".&nbsp; A duplicate copy of the button will appear in the 
			Designer &ndash;<br><br></li>
			<li>Drag the new button so it is located a little bit
		  below the move button.&nbsp; Edit the text of the new button so it
		  displays "Change Mood", and change the variable name for the button
				to <code>changeMoodButton</code>.&nbsp;<br><br></li> 
		<li>Right-click on the new
		  button and choose "Properties" from the bottom of the pop-up menu; 
		  change the "background" and "foreground" properties of this JButton
		  so that it displays dark blue text on an orange background. <br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li> Run the program now.&nbsp; You should now see two
buttons in the control panel area on the right, but wait a minute &ndash;<br>
<blockquote><em>clicking the Change Mood button doesn't do anything, because we need to 
	attach an action to this button.</em>&nbsp; We will add the actions in the next
	several steps so that the Change Mood button does something.</blockquote>
	</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> Add a method to the <code>MUPanel</code> class that
will change the mood of all RoundHead objects in the program: <br>
        <br>
        <ol type="a">
          <li> In the <b>MUPanel.java</b> file, find the <code>moveObjects</code>
method &#8212; copy this entire method, and paste the lines into the file immediately
		  after the <code>moveObjects</code> method.&nbsp; <br><br></li>
		<li>Rename the
copied method so that it is named <code><b>changeObjectMoods</b></code>,
and change the method call in the body of this method so that the <code>changeMood</code>
method of the <code>firstOne</code> object is invoked. </li>
	      </ol>
      </li>
	    
	    <li> Add an <code>actionPerformed</code> method for the Change Mood button: <br>
        <br>
        <ol type="a">
          <li> In "Design" view for the <b>MUFrame.java</b> file, double-click
		  on the changeMoodButton to attach an ActionPerformed method.&nbsp; Edit
the body of the <code>changeMoodButtonActionPerformed</code> method so that it
calls the <code>changeObjectMoods
            </code>method of the <code>muPanel</code> object, and then calls
			<code>repaint</code> for <code>muPanel</code>.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li> Run the program now, and if everything is working
correctly, the buttons should do what their labels say they do!&nbsp;
Test and fix your program as needed so that each time you click the
Change Mood button, the RoundHead changes from happy to sad or vice
versa. </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
      </li>
	    
	  </ol></ol>
<h2>Part 4: Add More Objects and Functionality</h2>
<ol start="7">
      

  <li><b>Change the existing RoundHead and add another RoundHead.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>In the constructor method of the <code>MUPanel</code> class, 
	  where we instantiate the RoundHead
called <code>firstOne</code>, change the instantiation so that the
RoundHead will have a green hat, is initially sad, and will initially
move 30 down instead of 30 up. <b>Run the program, test, and fix as
needed before proceeding.</b><br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Add a second RoundHead object to the program. Declare this
RoundHead in the <b>MUPanel</b> class, calling it <code>secondOne</code>,
instantiate it so that it
starts in position (300, 150) in the viewer, wears a blue hat, is
happy, and initially moves 60 pixels up.<br>
        <br><ul>
<li>Don't forget to change the <code>paintComponent</code> method 
of <b>MUPanel</b> so that
both RoundHead objects are asked to draw themselves.</li>
        <br>
<li>Also, don't forget to change both of the methods in <b>MUPanel</b> that ask RoundHead
objects to move and to change moods so that both objects are modified
	when the buttons are clicked. </li><br>
	  </ul>
	    </li>
        <li><b>Run, test, fix as needed before proceeding.</b><br>
        <br>
      </li>
	    
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Change the <code>draw</code> method of the RoundHead class.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Change the <code>draw</code> method of the RoundHead class so that happy
RoundHeads have yellow faces and sad ones have pink faces. Of course,
this will require the use of an <code>if/else</code> statement.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Run, test, fix.</b><br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Add three more RoundHeads to MUPanel.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Declare, instantiate, and use 3 more RoundHeads in the 
	  <b>MUPanel</b> class:<br>
        <br>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>a happy RoundHead at position (540, 150) with an orange
hat that moves up 6 pixels at a time<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>a sad RoundHead with a black hat who moves 10 pixels down
from an initial position of (400, 100)<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>a RoundHead whose hat color and mood reflect the way you
are feeling right now (and whose overall appearance is different from
any other RoundHead on the screen), located at position (15, 200) and
moving 15 pixels up.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
	    <li><b>Run, test, fix.</b><br><br></li> &nbsp;
	    <li>There should now be a total of 5 RoundHeads that can move
around in the application window, and be changed from happy to sad
and sad to happy.<br> <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Add the ability to move the RoundHeads horizontally.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Edit the <code>RoundHead</code> class.<br>
        <br>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Add one additional private data member, which will
represent the horizontal step size that a RoundHead should take when
the move button is clicked.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Modify the constructor method so that it expects one
additional parameter, and uses it to initialize the added private data
member.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Add a new method called <code><b>moveHorizontally</b></code>.
You may use the existing <code>moveVertically</code> method as a
guide, but now worry about turning around horizontally to avoid going
off the left or right of the viewer window rather than worrying about
turning around vertically to avoid going off the top or bottom of the
viewer window.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Edit the <code>MUPanel</code> class.<br>
        <br>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>In the constructor method of the <b>MUPanel</b>
class, change the instantiations of your RoundHeads, adding the
required additional parameter. Make the first RoundHead move 5 pixels
left initially, the second RoundHead move 25 pixels right, the third
RoundHead not move horizontally at all, and the fourth and fifth
RoundHeads move any horizontal amount and direction you wish.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Now add a sixth RoundHead (declare and instantiate) that
is sad, wears a yellow hat, moves left 10 pixels at a time without
moving up or down at all, and starts at position (50, 300).<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Change the <code><b>moveObjects</b></code> method to
call the <code>moveHorizontally</code> method of each of the RoundHead
objects in addition to the <code>moveVertically</code> methods.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>Run, test, fix.</b> Are there <b>six</b> RoundHeads, some
moving only horizontally, some only vertically, and some diagonally (both 
horizontally and vertically in the same step)?<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Make the RoundHeads have different sizes and give them
nickNames.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The RoundHead class already has a size data member, but the
constructor always assigns a value of 30 to size. Change the
constructor to expect an additional parameter for initializing the
size. Then change the instantatitions of RoundHeads in the MUPanel
class, giving each RoundHead a different size.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Run, test, fix.</b><br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Add a <code>String</code> data member called nickName to the
RoundHead class. Edit the constructor accordingly and the
instantiations of RoundHeads in the MUPanel class. Edit the draw
method of the RoundHead class so that the nickName is drawn beneath the
RoundHead using
        <pre>g.drawString(nickName, ?, ?);</pre>
      </li>
      <li><b>Run, test, fix.</b><br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

</ol>
	
  <h2>Part 5 Challenge:&nbsp; Grow and Shrink the RoundHeads</h2>
    <ol start="12">
      <li>Add a method in the RoundHead class called <b><code>grow</code></b>.<br><br>
<ol type="a">
<li>This method returns nothing (void), and has no parameters. The body of
the method makes the size grow by 50%.
        <pre>            size = size + size/2;</pre>
	</li>
</li>
      <li>Add a method in the <b>MUPanel</b> class called <code>growTheObjects</code>.

This method should call the grow method for each of the RoundHead
objects.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>In the <b>MUFrame</b> class, add another 
JButton called <code>growButton</code>.&nbsp; Using the same style as
was used for the other buttons in your application, give the <code>growButton</code>
meaninful label text, set its colors, add the actionPerformed method, etc.
Follow the pattern that was used for the other buttons.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The <code><b>actionPerformed</b></code> method for the
<code>growButton</code> should call the <code>growTheObjects</code>
method of the <code>muPanel</code> object before repainting the <code>muPanel</code>.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Run, test, fix.</b> Try your new button. It should grow
each RoundHead every time you click it.<br>
        <br>
	    </li></ol>
	<li>Add a method in the RoundHead class called <code>shrink</code><br><br>
		<ol type="a"><li>Next, add a button to shrink the RoundHeads by 50% each time a button is clicked.&nbsp; If an
  individual RoundHead's size 
  is less than 10, it should not shrink when the button is clicked.<br>
    <br>
	<li><b>Run, test, fix.</b> Try your new button. It should grow
each RoundHead every time you click it.<br>
        <br>
			</li></ol>
	    <li>Add comments documenting your challenge work.  Extra credit may be earned on this Lab, but only if
		    your work is fully documented in your code comments.</li>
  </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

</ol>	

  <h2>Part 6: Lab 6 Submission<br></h2>
    <ol start="15">
  <li>
	Create and submit your project to the D2L Dropbox.<br><br>
	  <ol type="a">
		  <li>Run your program and move the RoundHeads around 
			  by clicking buttons, and change their moods.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
		  <li>Then create a screen capture of your output
			  window and save it using a descriptive and meaningful name inside your project src folder.<br><br></li>
