CSC 120 Lab 1
</font>
</h2>

<p>
This lab will introduce the NetBeans IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) for Java programming, and the programming process of
declaring, instantiating, and using objects from pre-existing Java
classes.

<p><font size="+1"><b>Part 1: Use File Explorer to create a storage folder for your Java projects for this course.</b></font><br/><br/>
	You need a common place on your computer or the Mount Union network, or on the computer you will be working on regularly, to store 
	all of your work for this class.&nbsp; We suggest 
	that you use your H: drive on the Mount Union network (VPN access is required off campus), because our IT department backs 
	up all student work space regularly, so 
	in the event of a device failure you will be able to recover your work.&nbsp; But you can choose to store your Java programs
	anywhere that is convenient for you.<br/><br/>
						     
	The following steps will guide you to create a folder on your H: drive on the campus network step-by-step.&nbsp; As long as 
	you create a CSC120 folder somewhere for your files, you can have this folder anywhere that fits your working style.&nbsp; 
	Find a different location that you prefer and use it in place of the <b>H:\</b> drive in steps 2 and 3.  For consistency throughout 
	the instructions in this course, we will always make reference the H: drive.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Open File Explorer.<br>
				<br>
			<li>Browse to your H: drive, which is your personal file space on the 
				campus network.<br><br>
			<li>In the folder <b>H:\</b>, create a new folder and name it <b>CSC120</b>
				(choose <b>File | New | Folder</b> from the menu, then type <b>CSC120</b> (uppercase 
				C, uppercase S, uppercase C, the digit 1, the digit 2, the digit 0, with NO SPACES!) and 
				press the [Enter] key.&nbsp; Then double-click on the <b>CSC120</b> folder name in the right pane.<br>
				<br>
	                 <li>In the <b>CSC120</b> folder you just made, create a new folder and name it <b>Java</b>
        	                (choose <b>File | New | Folder</b> from the menu, then type <b>Java</b> (uppercase
                	        J, lowercase all other letters, with NO SPACES!) and press the [Enter] key.<br><br>
			<li>Double-check that you have a <b>CSC120</b> folder that contains a <b>Java</b> folder in the storage location
				that you used (if you followed these steps, the location will be your H: drive).&nbsp; All future instructions
				will refer to your <b>CSC120\Java</b> folder when asking you to copy files or otherwise work with your Java
				projects.<br/><br/>
			<li>Minimize Windows Explorer by clicking on the underscore symbol in the upper 
				right hand corner of the window; do NOT click on the X - that would close the 
				application instead of &quot;setting it aside&quot;.<br>
				<br>

<ol>

  <li>Watch the following video
      that demonstrates how to use NetBeans to create a Java application (suggestion:  watch in full-screen mode for best effect).&nbsp; This video was updated on Monday, Aug 24 to reflect the
	  way course materials are organized for the Fall 2020 semester.<br /><br />

	  <br/><br/></li>

  <li>Restarting/pausing/resuming the video as needed, follow the steps in the video to create
      your first Java Application, called <b>PracticeProject</b>.<br /><br /></li>
      
  <li>Make sure that you can run your application.
      It should display a white window with the message <b>Hello World</b> near the middle.<br /><br /></li>
      
  <li>Click the X in the upper right corner of the program output window to stop your program.<br /><br /></li>
      
  <li>In NetBeans under the Files tab on the left expand the src folder and double-click MUPanel.java
      to open the file in the editor window.<br /><br /></li>

  <li>Watch the following video</a>
      that gives an overview of the MUPanel class (suggestion:  watch in full-screen mode for best effect)<br /><br />

	  <br/><br/></li>

  <li>Restart/pause/resume the video as needed, while you edit your PracticeProject application.
      Change the size of the program's window from 800x600 to 500x300, run the program to see the effect,
      change the size to 250x700, run it again,
      change the background color from WHITE to some other color, then run it again; 
	  <a href="JavaColorNames.html" target="_blank"> Here is a list of color names</a> you can use
	  in Java.&nbsp; Next, 
      change the window's name from "Java Program authored by Samantha Student" 
	  to <b>CSC 120 Lab 1 authored by </b> and put your name in place of Samantha's.&nbsp; Then run the
	  program again.<br /><br /></li>
      
  <li>Close the PracticeProject project by following these steps:&nbsp; click on the "Projects" tab in the left-hand column of the 
      IDE window so that the PracticeProject name is shown with a coffee cup icon beside it.&nbsp; Then right-click on the project
	  name, and choose "Close" from the pop-up menu (Close will be about halfway down the list of options).<br /><br /></li>
