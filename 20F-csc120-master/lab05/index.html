    In this lab we will use the NetBeans GUI Designer to create programs that respond to
	user input operations, and practice using <code>if</code> statements.
</font>

<hr/>
	<h2>Part 1</h2>
<ol>
    <li> When we write programs that respond to user input actions, we need to use a different starting template
	     than we have been using so far this semester.&nbsp; We recommend that you copy the template
	    files into your <b>CSC120</b> folder, so you will have them to use any time you want to start a new
		 interactive program. <br/><br/>
		 
		 To do this, use a web browser to visit the <a href="../resources.html" target="_blank"> CSC 120 Resources page</a>.&nbsp;
		 In the "Starter Templates for 
		 Java Programmnig" section, right-click on the link that says "MUFrameWithGUIDesigner.zip" and choose
	    "Save File as..." from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; Browse to your <b>CSC120</b> folder and save the zip file.
		 <br/><br/>
		 Next, launch File Explorer and browse to your CSC120 folder.&nbsp; Right-click on the
		 .zip file you just saved, and choose "Extract all" from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; Make sure that the files
		 will be extracted into a folder in your CSC120 folder, and check the box that says "Show extracted files
		 when complete".&nbsp; Then click the "Extract" button.&nbsp; A new File Explorer window will appear, and you
		 should browse as deep in the folder as you can, until you see three files named "MUFrame.form", "MUFrame.java"
		 and "MUPanel.java".&nbsp; Highlight all three of these files now, and right-click on them to choose "Copy".
	     <br/><br/> </li>
	<li>For this lab there are three parts, so it is recommended that you create a lab folder inside your <strong>CSC120</strong> 
		folder to store all three parts.  An appropriate name would be <strong>Lab5-LastName</strong> so you can zip and submit 
		all three parts to the Lab 5 dropbox in D2L without issues as a single file.</li>
    <li> Launch NetBeans, and create a new Java Application project named <em>Lab5</em> in your
         <b>CSC120</b> folder.&nbsp; Expand the tree for this new project so that you can see the <b>src</b>
		 folder for the project, and paste <b><u>ALL THREE</u></b>
		 files you copied in the previous step into the <b>src</b> folder.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; only the two .java
		 files will show up in the tree.&nbsp;
		 Run the MUFrame program by right clicking on the file named <b>MUFrame.java</b> and choose
		 "Run File" from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; You should obtain a graphical output window that displays
		 "Hello World" if you copied all the files properly. <br/><br/> </li>

    <li> Double-click on the <b>MUFrame.java</b> filename to open the file in the NetBeans editor, and 
	     at the top of the editor pane you will see the following: <br/>
		 <img src="EditorTabs.png"> <br/>
		 Notice the two buttons labeled "Source" and "Design" &mdash; you will use these to switch
		 between different views of the file.&nbsp; Click on the "Source" button now, and notice that 
		 the view changes so that you can see the Java code for the program.&nbsp; Scroll down in this
		 file and you will see that this MUFrame class has a constructor method, plus a lot of other
		 stuff that we won't be directly modifying.&nbsp; When we make changes in Design view, NetBeans
		 will insert code in this file to support the GUI components we add to the interface.<br/><br/>

		 Click on the "Design" button to return to the GUI Designer.&nbsp; One thing we will always want to do when 
		 writing interactive programs is to change the name that is displayed in the title of the frame
		 of the output window.&nbsp; If you run the program now, you will notice that the title of the 
		 output window says "Program authored by Samantha Student" &mdash; 
		 since that is not your name, we need to know how to change this so that your name appears as the author of
		 your programs.&nbsp; On the right side of the screen you will see two tabs, one over the other; the top one
		 says "Palette" and the bottom one says [JFrame] - Properties".&nbsp; In the Properties list in the latter
		 section, find the property named "title", and click on the button that shows 3 dots on the right of that entry;
		 then in the dialog that appears, change Samantha Student to your name.&nbsp; Here are screen captures of
		 what the dialogs will look like: <br>
		 <img src="TitleProperty.png" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <img src="TitleProperty2.png" /> <br/><br/>
		 After clicking the OK button, run the program and make sure that your name appears in the window title, not
		 Samantha's.<br/><br/>  </li>
		 
    <li> Still in the GUI Designer view, in the "Palette" area of the
		 right side of the screen, find the "Button" icon and text in the "Swing Controls" area
		 &ndash; it looks like this: <br/>
		 <img src="SwingControls.png"> <br/>
		 Click on "Button" (not on Toggle Button), and when you hover the mouse over the screen area,
		 a button will appear.&nbsp; If you click the mouse, the button will be anchored in the
		 screen area.&nbsp; You can click and drag the button to a new location, and you can resize the
		 button by using the dragging handles that appear on the edges of the button.<br/><br/>

		 We will always want to make two changes to GUI components when we add them to the Designer &mdash;
		 we should change the text displayed in/on the component, and we should change the name of the variable
		 in the program that refers to the component, to use a name that is suited to the task we are performing.
		 &nbsp;Right-click on the button you just added to the Designer and choose the "Edit Text" option 
	    	(properties - properties - text) from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; Change the default text on the face of the button to "Click Me!".&nbsp;
		 Then right-click again on the button and choose the "Change Variable Name..." option (properties - code - variables), and rename the 
		 variable as "myButton".<br/><br/>

		 Run the MUFrame program and there should be a button on the screen that says "Click Me!".&nbsp; Try
		 clicking it a few times &ndash; nothing happens yet, because we need to attach actions to the
		 button.&nbsp; It's kind of annoying to have the "Hello World" message on the screen, so let's get rid of
		 that by double-clicking on the <b>MUPanel.java</b> file to open the MUPanel class, and then
		 deleting the <code>g.drawString</code> method from the <code>paintComponent</code> method.&nbsp; Run
		 the program again &ndash; that looks better doesn't it?&nbsp; Close the program window now to return
		 to NetBeans, and switch back to the MUFrame.java tab in the editor.<br/><br/> </li>

    <li> Now for a very important step:&nbsp; we must attach an action to our button that will be activated when
         the user clicks the button.&nbsp; To do this, double-click on the button in the Designer, which will
		 cause the display to switch to the Source view of the program.&nbsp; You will see a new method that
		 NetBeans has added to your program called <code>myButtonActionPerformed</code>; this method will contain
		 code that will be executed every time the user clicks on the button when the program is running.&nbsp;
		 Let's add a simple action that will show that the button is working &mdash; inside the curly braces of
		 this new method, add the following code:
<pre>
    System.out.println("The button was clicked");
</pre>		 
		 Run the program, and now every time the button is clicked, a new line is displayed in the Java Console.&nbsp;
		 Ask your instructor for help if this doesn't happen for you, or if you have questions about this.
		 <br/><br/> </li>

    <li> We can add variables, objects and other methods to the MUFrame.java file to perform processing operations.
	     &nbsp;As an example, be sure you are in Source view for the MUFrame.java file in the editor window, and scroll
		 up toward the top of the program to the comment that says "// declare private data here"; right under that comment,
		 declare an Integer variable named <code>timesClicked</code>.&nbsp; 
<pre>
   private Integer timesClicked;
</pre>
	Now, inside the constructor method for the
		 MUFrame class, insert an assignment statement that stores the value zero in <code>timesClicked</code>    
<pre>
   timesClicked = 0;
</pre>
	    Next, change the code in the <b>myButtonActionPerformed</b> method to the following:
<pre>
    timesClicked = timesClicked + 1;
    System.out.println("Times the button has been clicked: " + timesClicked);
</pre>		 
		 When you run this version of the program, a message will appear in the Java Console that includes a count
		 of how many times you have clicked the button.&nbsp; Run the program several times to test it out, and then
		 close the <b>Lab5</b> project.
		 <br/><br/> </li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Part 2</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Create a new NetBeans Java Application project named <em>Lab5-Part2</em> in your
	    <b>CSC120</b> folder (<strong>No spaces in the project name, please!</strong>).&nbsp; 
		 Using File Explorer, copy <b><em>ALL THREE</em></b>
		 files from the <b>MUFrame with GUI designer</b> folder in your CSC120 folder, and paste
		 them into the <b>src</b> folder of this new project.&nbsp; Edit the <b>MUPanel.java</b>
		 file and remove the <code>g.drawString</code> statement from the paintComponent method.&nbsp;
		 We will make a simple form that asks for three <code>String</code> values as input from the user
		 and prints a result in a TextArea on the screen when the button is clicked. <br/><br/>
		 
		 Double-click the "MUFrame.java" file to open the GUI Designer, and use the Designer to make a 
		 data entry form that looks like <a href="NameForm.png" target="_blank"> this
		 example</a>.&nbsp; To do this, add the below components to the Designer display in the order presented in the table,
	         positioning them approximately
		 in the positions shown in the example, and making them approximately the same size as in the example:<br/><br/>
		 <table border="1" width="80%" align="center">
		  <tr style="background-color: #dcd0ff;">
		    <th width="10%"> Step # </th>
		    <th width="30%"> Type of Component </th>
		    <th width="30%"> Edit Text to be ... </th>
		    <th width="30%"> Change Variable Name to ... </th>
		  </tr>
		  <tr> <th align="center" style="background-color: #dcd0ff;"> 1 </th>
		       <td align="center"> Label </td>
		       <td align="center"> Enter First Name: </td>
			<td align="center"> firstNameLabel </td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr style="background-color: #e6e6fa;"> 
			 <th align="center" style="background-color: #dcd0ff;"> 2 </th>
		       <td align="center"> TextField </td>
		       <td align="center"> nothing (delete the default text) </td>
			   <td align="center"> firstNameField </td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr> <th align="center" style="background-color: #dcd0ff;"> 3 </th>
		       <td align="center"> Label </td>
		       <td align="center"> Enter Middle Initial: </td>
			   <td align="center"> middleInitLabel </td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr style="background-color: #e6e6fa;"> 
			  <th align="center" style="background-color: #dcd0ff;"> 4 </th>
		       <td align="center"> TextField </td>
		       <td align="center"> nothing </td>
			   <td align="center"> middleInitField </td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr> <th align="center" style="background-color: #dcd0ff;"> 5 </th>
		       <td align="center"> Label </td>
		       <td align="center"> Enter Last Name: </td>
			   <td align="center"> lastNameLabel </td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr style="background-color: #e6e6fa;"> 
			  <th align="center" style="background-color: #dcd0ff;"> 6 </th>
		       <td align="center"> TextField </td>
		       <td align="center"> nothing </td>
			   <td align="center"> lastNameField </td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr> <th align="center" style="background-color: #dcd0ff;"> 7 </th>
		       <td align="center"> Button </td>
		       <td align="center"> Process Input Data </td>
			   <td align="center"> theButton </td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr style="background-color: #e6e6fa;"> 
			  <th align="center" style="background-color: #dcd0ff;"> 8 </th>
		       <td align="center"> TextArea </td>
		       <td align="center"> nothing </td>
			   <td align="center"> outputArea </td>
		  </tr>
		 </table>
		 <br/>
		 Run the program and see if the Graphical Output Window looks like the sample.&nbsp; Keep adjusting the
		 GUI components in the Designer until your output looks like the example.
		 <br/><br/> </li>

    <li> In the Designer view, double-click on the button, and then paste this code into the method named
         <code>theButtonActionPerformed</code>:
<pre>
        String fName = firstNameField.getText();
        String mInit = middleInitField.getText();
        String lName = lastNameField.getText();
	
        String ans = fName + " " + mInit + ". " + lName;
	
        outputArea.setText("Full Name is " + ans);
</pre>		 
		 Run the program, and enter a series of names, clicking the button each time.&nbsp; The program should
		 display the full names for the latest data you've entered. <strong>If your program does not display the full names
	    	STOP and troubleshoot your code.  Do not move on until you have the previous steps completed and working.</strong> <br/><br/>
	</li><li>
		 What if we wanted to see all the names that we've entered?&nbsp; The current version of the program
		 replaces the previous name with the new name.&nbsp; If we want to preserve the output we've generated so
		 far, and add new output to the end of the outputArea, we can do that by replacing the <code>setText</code>
		 method that we're calling for outputArea with the <code>append</code> method.&nbsp; Make this change and
		 then run the program, entering several names.&nbsp; <br/>
<!--pre>
        outputArea.append("Full Name is " + ans);
</pre-->		 
		<br/> 
		 Hey wait a minute &ndash; why are they all on the
		 same line?&nbsp; It turns out that the append method puts new text immediately after the last character that
		 is in the outputArea, without regard to what line it is on.&nbsp; If we want to cause each name to be
		 displayed on a separate line in the outputArea, we need to append the "\n" escape sequence to the output
		 after the full name.&nbsp; To do this, change the <code>append</code> method call in your program to 
		 this one:
<pre>
        outputArea.append("Full Name is " + ans + "\n");
</pre>
        Run the program and enter several names &ndash; that's better, don't you think?
		 <br/><br/> </li>

    <li> It's kind of a pain to have to delete the previous names from the text fields to enter a new name; luckily
	     there is a way to automatically clear out the fields so that they are empty when we go to enter a new
		 name.&nbsp; To do this, as the last lines in the theButtonActionPerformed method, 
		 call the <code>setText</code> method for each of the three TextFields in the program
		 (firstNameField, middleInitField and lastNameField), and for each of those method calls, 
		 use the parameter "" (that's two quotes with
		 NOTHING in between -- in other words, it's the empty string).&nbsp;Run the program and notice that
		 when you click the button, the fields are blanked out so you can enter new names without erasing the previous
		 names. <br/><br/> </li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Part 3</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Close the <b>Lab5Part2</b> project, and then create a new NetBeans Java Application project named 
	     <em>Lab5Part3</em> in your
         <b>CSC120</b> folder (NO SPACES IN THE PROJECT NAME, PLEASE!).&nbsp; 
		 Right-click on this link to the <a href="Lab5Part3Files.zip"> Lab5Part3Files.zip</a> file, and save this file
		 to your CSC120 folder.&nbsp; Extract all from this .zip file, and then use File Explorer to copy the three files 
		 you just extracted into the <b>src</b> folder of your new project.&nbsp; Now, back in NetBeans, run the <b>MUFrame.java</b>
		 program and you should see a green text message displayed on the screen.&nbsp; Every time you click the 
		 button, the text is moved a little bit to the right. <br/><br/> </li>
		 
    <li> Open the <b>MUPanel.java</b> file in NetBeans, and find the <code>g.setColor</code> statement in the
	     paintComponent method.&nbsp; Put an <code>if</code> statement around this statement so that the
		 color will be set to GREEN only if <code>horizPos</code> is smaller than 350.&nbsp; Then add an 
		 <code>else</code> to go along with the <code>if</code> that will set the color to RED if the Boolean
		 test in the <code>if</code> statement is false.&nbsp; Run the program and keep clicking the button until
		 the text changes to RED.&nbsp; Run and test the program to see if the text changes color when it reaches
		 the right half of the output window.<br/><br/> </li>
		 
    <li> Now, let's add the ability for the program to move the message down the screen.&nbsp; In the <b>MUPanel.java</b>
    	 file, make a duplicate copy of the method named <code><b>moveRight</b></code> and rename the duplicate so
		 that the new method name is <code><b>moveDown</b></code>.&nbsp; The body of the method should add 40 to the
		 <code>vertPos</code> variable instead of <code>horizPos</code>.&nbsp; Then in the <b>MUFrame.java</b> file,
		 in the Designer, add a new Button to the interface, make the text on the face of the button say "Move Down", 
		 change the variable name to "moveDownButton", and then double-click on the button to define the action to
		 be performed when the button is clicked.&nbsp; There are two things to do when the button is clicked; first
		 of all, call the <code>moveDown</code> method of the <code>muPanel</code> object, and then call the
		 <code>repaint</code> method of the <code>muPanel</code>.&nbsp; Use the action performed code for the moveRightButton
		 as a guide for what to do here, and ask your instructor for help if you need to.&nbsp; Run the program,
		 and test the Move Down button to see if it works properly.<br/><br/> </li>
		 
    <li> Can you add <code>if</code> statements to the <code>paintComponent</code> method of MUPanel so that the
	     drawing color is set according to these rules?<br/><br/>
		 <table width="65%">
		   <tr bgcolor="#00cc00">
		     <td width="75%"> &nbsp; upper-left quadrant <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; (horizontal less than 350 AND vertical less than 300) </td>
			 <td width="25%"> &nbsp; GREEN </td>
		   </tr>
		   <tr bgcolor="#cc0000">
		     <td width="75%"> <font color="#ffff00"> &nbsp; upper-right quadrant <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (horizontal NOT less than 350 AND vertical less than 300) </td>
			 <td width="25%"> <font color="#ffff00"> &nbsp; RED </td>
		   </tr>
		   <tr bgcolor="#00cccc">
		     <td width="75%"> <font color="#0000ff"> &nbsp; lower-left quadrant <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (horizontal less than 350 AND vertical NOT less than 300) </td>
			 <td width="25%"> <font color="#0000ff"> &nbsp; CYAN </td>
		   </tr>
		   <tr bgcolor="#cc00cc">
		     <td width="75%"> <font color="#ffff00"> &nbsp; lower-right quadrant <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (you should be able to figure this out...!) </td>
			 <td width="25%"> <font color="#ffff00"> &nbsp; MAGENTA </td>
		   </tr>
		 </table> <br/>
		 Helpful hint:&nbsp; it will be much easier to code this into your program if you use 4 
		 <b><code>if</code></b> statements without any <b><code>else</code></b> clauses to set the colors		 
		 correctly.&nbsp; You should use the <code><b>&amp;&amp;</b></code> operator to set up a compound test in each of the four
		 <b><code>if</code></b> statements.&nbsp; Run and test your program so that the colors change to the proper value when 
		 the text moves into different quadrants of the screen.
		 <br/><br/> </li>
		 
  <li>  Add two more buttons to the program to allow the user to move the message to the LEFT and also to move the message UP
		    on the screen.&nbsp; These buttons should call methods that are similar to how we moved the message RIGHT and DOWN. <br/><br/>
  </li>

    <li> When you have finished this lab, obtain screen captures of the output windows for both Lab5-Part2 and Lab5-Part3, saving
	     both of them as .png files.&nbsp; Be sure to have more than one name displayed on screen for Part2, and to have moved the 
	         message to the lower-right quadrant of the screen for Part3.&nbsp; Your name must be displayed in the title of the frame
	    of the display windows.&nbsp;
		 Next, use File Explorer to make a .zip files of your entire Lab 5 folder including all parts into a single zip file.  If you didn't
	    	create a Lab5-LastName folder, you will need to zip <b>CSC120\Lab5-Part2</b> and 
	     <b>CSC120\Lab5Part3</b> folders into a single zip file.&nbsp; Then turn <b>ALL OF THE FILES</b> into the Lab5 dropbox in 
		 <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank"> D2L</a>. <em>Note, be sure to follow the guidance provided by your professor 
	    regarding requirements for submitting one or more files.</em><br/><br/>
