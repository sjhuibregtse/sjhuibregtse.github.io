In this lab we will:
<ul>
    <li>Add a Java source file for an existing class created by someone else to a project.
    </li>
    <li>Change an existing class by adding data properties and revising methods.
    </li>
    <li>Practice using several of the drawing methods of the Graphics class.
    </li>
</ul>

    <li><b>Create a new NetBeans project called Lab3 in your CSC120\Java folder, then copy the Boat &amp; MUPanel classes.</b><br /><br />

        <ol>
            <li>Visit the <a href="../resources.html" target="_blank">CSC 120 Resources Page</a>, click the link
    			at the bottom of the page to "MU Java Classes" and
			    save the <b>Boat.java</b> file to the src folder of your project.<br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>In your web browser <b>right-click</b>
                on <b><a href="MUPanel.java"> this MUPanel.java</a></b> and save
                the file into the src folder of your Lab3 project.<br /><br />
            </li>
            
            <li>In NetBeans open the MUPanel.java file to edit it.
                Look over the comment header at the top, and change the name and date
                to your name and today's date.
                In the MUPanel constructor, set the panel name to "CSC 120 Lab 3 by Samantha Student" (but be sure to use <b><em>your name</em></b> instead of Samantha's!)
                replacing "Java Program" in the <code>setName</code> statement.<br /><br />
            </li>
            
            <li>Notice where we have <b>declared</b> a Boat object called <code>boat1</code>,
                <b>instantiated/constructed</b> the Boat object passing specific values
                for over and down to the Boat constructor method,
                and <b>used</b> the Boat object by calling its <code>draw</code> method
                and its <code>toString</code> method.<br /><br />
            </li>
            
            <li>Run the program to see what it does.
                <b>System.out.println</b> "prints" (displays) stuff in the Java Console window
                (the <b><em>Output</em></b> window in the bottom part of NetBeans).
                System.out.println always expects you to pass it a String parameter
                or stuff that is concatenated (glued together) to make a String.
                Using + with literal numbers and integer variables adds them together as expected,
                but using + between a literal String or a String variable and another String
                or even a number does String concatenation. We'll use String concatenation
                and System.out.println often.<br /><br />
            </li>
        </ol>

    </li>

    <li><b>Edit the project's MUPanel.java file to declare, instantiate, and use more Boats.</b><br /><br />

        <ol>

            <li>In the MUPanel.java file edit the Java code to declare Boat
                objects called <code>boat2</code> and <code>boat3</code>. You may either add a separate line for each
                declaration and mimic the style we used to declare <code>boat1</code>, or you may declare all three
				Boat objects with one line of code. Don't forget
                the semicolon on the end of every line.<br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>In the constructor method of the MUPanel.java file, where we have
                instantiated our <code>boat1</code>, add lines of Java code to instantiate
				<code>boat2</code> and
                <code>boat3</code>, using different values for the overs and downs and the names of the boats. Also, add lines
                of Java code to use System.out.println and the <code>toString</code> method of these
                Boats to display information about them in the Java Console.<br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>In the <code>paintComponent</code> method of the MUPanel.java file we have asked
                <coat>boat1</code> to draw itself. Add lines of Java code to ask the other Boats to
                draw themselves.<br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>Run the program, fix any errors that are noted, etc. until
                you get it to run properly, showing all three Boats in the program
                display window and printing information about all three Boats in the
                Java Console.<br /><br />
            </li>
        
        </ol>

    <li><b>Edit the Boat.java file to make changes to the Boat class.</b><br /><br />

            <li>Click <a href="Lab3Finished.png" target="_blank">HERE</a>
                to see an example of how your Boats should look after you change the
                Boat class. Your Boats may not look exactly like this: the positions
                (overs &amp; downs) will be different, the names will be different, and
                the port holes may be located differently, but this shows you the ideas
                of the names on the sails, the port holes, and the mast support lines.<br /><br />
            </li>
            
            <li>Open the Boat.java file and make the following changes.
                <font color="red">You are strongly encouraged to draw a
                picture of a Boat on paper, and label coordinates and distances to help
                you figure out what values to use in the following drawOvals,
                fillOvals, drawString, and drawLines!!</font><br /><br />
                
                <ol type="a">
                
                    <li>In the <code>draw</code> method right after the comment "// port holes"
                        add lines of Java code to make three port holes. For each port hole set
                        the color for the Graphics object called <code>g</code> to Color.YELLOW, use the
                        fillOval method of <code>g</code> to make a solid yellow circle, set the <code>g</code> color to
                        Color.BLACK, and finally use the drawOval method to make a hollow black
                        oval outlining the yellow oval.<br /><br />
						
						NOTE:&nbsp; All of your code MUST draw the shapes that will make the portholes
						<em>relative</em> to the <b><code>anchorX</code></b> and <b><code>anchorY</code></b> points of the
						Boat.&nbsp; In other words:<br/>
						<table width="80%" align="center">
						    <tr>
							    <th width="65%" align="left"> Do stuff like this: </th>
								<th width="35%" align="left"> But NOT like this: </th>
							</tr>
						    <tr>
							    <td width="65%"> <code> g.drawOval(anchorX &ndash; 15, anchorY + 30, 20, 20);</code> </td>
								<td width="35%"> <code> g.drawOval(85, 215, 20, 20);</code> </td>
							</tr>
						</table><br/>

                        Rerun the project, then re-edit Boat.java as needed, getting your
                        port holes the way you want them before proceeding.<br /><br />
                    </li>
                
                    <li>In the <code>draw</code> method right after the comment "// name on the
                        sail" add lines of Java code to set the color to Color.BLACK and use
                        the <code>drawString</code> method of the <code>g</code> object to display the name of the Boat
                        on the sail.<br /><br />

                        Rerun, fix, run, test, fix, etc.<br /><br />

                    <li>In the <code>draw</code> method right after the comment "// lines
                        steadying the mast" add code to set the color to Color.YELLOW and use
                        the <code>drawLine</code> method of the <code>g</code> object to draw lines from the front and
                        back of the Boat to the top of the mast. Recompile, run, test, fix, etc.<br /><br />
                    </li>
                
                    <li>Continue running the program, fixing any errors that are noted, etc. until
                        you get it to run without errors and display appropriately.<br /><br />
                    </li>
                
                    <li>You may add other features to your Boat class, if you like.<br /><br />

    <li><b>Add a fourth Boat object.</b><br /><br />
        <ol>
            <li>Edit the MUPanel.java file to declare, instantiate and draw a fourth Boat object
			    so that it is displayed on the screen in a way that doesn't overlap the other boats, and 
				so that it has a different name than the other boats shown on its sail.&nbsp; Do <b>NOT</b>
				make any changes to the Boat class to do this.<br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>If you wrote the <code>draw</code> method of your Boat class correctly, your fourth boat will 
			    have portholes in the proper place, lines from the mast to the boat deck, etc.&nbsp; If you used
				numbers instead of drawing things relative to the (anchorX, anchorY) point of the Boat, then your
				new boat won't have portholes.&nbsp; Ask your instructor for help if your fourth boat isn't displayed
				correctly.<br/><br/>

    <li><b>Hand in your Lab3 Project.</b><br /><br />
      <ol>
	    <li>Run your program and obtain a screen capture of the window that includes the title in the frame that shows your name, and save
