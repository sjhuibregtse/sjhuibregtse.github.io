        <!--h4>Note: You should <b>not</b> work on this assignment during lecture or lab class-time unless:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>You have completed all of the in-class assigned work for the day, and</li>
            <li>You have permission from the instructor.</li>

		<h4> This assignment must be submitted to the PA2 dropbox in D2L by the posted due date and time.</h4>

        <h3> Overview:</h3>
		<blockquote>
    		You are to create your own Java class that contains a minimum of four (4) properties, at least two
			of which must be some numeric type (<code>Integer</code> or <code>Double</code>).&nbsp; Then you must 
			write code in an MUPanel class that declares and instantiates at least five (5) objects from
			your class and displays lines of text that shows that the objects from your class work
			correctly.
		</blockquote>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>	
		<p><strong>As a reminder, it is expected that each student will complete this assignment INDIVIDUALLY.  Contact your professor
			if you need to discuss your project plan.</strong></p>
        	
		<ol>
			<li>Initial Set-up.<br /><br />
			
			    <ol type="a">
			        <li>Create a NetBeans Java Application named PA2, and copy the MUPanel.java file from your Lab4
			            project into the src folder of the PA2 project.</b><br /><br />
			        </li>
			        <li>Do not try to run the program (yet). The program from Lab4 uses 
					    <code>ClothingItem</code> and <code>Coffee</code> objects.&nbsp; However, you do not
			            have those two classes in the src folder of your project, so NetBeans will
			            complain about the fact that the those classes don't exist!<br /><br />
			        </li>
			    </ol>
			</li>
	    
			<li>Create your class.<br /><br />
			
			    <ol type="a">
			        <li>You need to design your class before you continue!
			            You are not allowed to use a ClothingItem class or a Coffee class for this
						assignment.&nbsp; Try to think of a class
			            that nobody else will use.<br /><br />
			        </li>
				    <li>In the Files tab of your project, right-click on the src folder
				        and choose "New | Java Class..." and set the <b>Class Name:</b>
				        to be the name you've chosen for your class. Be sure you
				        capitalize the name and don't use any spaces. For example
				        you could use <b>Airplane</b>, but <b>not airplane</b>,
				        and <b>not Air&nbsp;Plane</b>.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>Edit the new class. Change the comment header to say
				        the name of the class, your name, and the date.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>Your class will need at least 4 properties (private data members),
				        and at least two of them must be a numeric type (you can use either <code>Integer</code>
						or <code>Double</code> as the data type for these properties).<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>Make a constructor for your class that accepts a parameter for each of the
					    properties,
				        and uses them to initialize the corresponding properties of the object.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li> Make <em><strong>getter</strong></em> and <em><strong>setter</strong></em> methods for each of the properties 
					    of your class.&nbsp; The 
					    <em><strong>getter</strong></em> and <em><strong>setter</strong></em>
					     methods.  The <em><strong>getter</strong></em> method should return the proper data type for each of the properties, 
					    and the <em><strong>setter</strong></em> methods should assign values appropriately. &nbsp; Rewatch the getter 
					    and setter video for assistance.<br /><br/>
				    <li>Make a <code>toString</code> method that returns a <code>String</code> 
					    that describes the object in terms of its properties.&nbsp; Refer to the
						<code>toString</code> method in the classes from Lab4.<br /><br />
						
					<li>Make a method that performs a calculation with two or more numeric properties of your class, similar
					    to the <code><b>calculateTotalSpent</b></code> method of the <code>ClothingItem</code> class and the
						<code><b>calculatePricePerOunce</b></code> method of the <code>Coffee</code> class.<br/><br/>
						
			    </ol>
			</li>
	    
			<li>Modify the <code>MUPanel</code> to use your class.<br /><br />
			
			    <ol type="a">
				    <li>The <code>MUPanel</code> from Lab4 declares <code>ClothingItem</code> and
    					<code>Coffee</code> objects.&nbsp; Change the declarations in the MUPanel.java
				        file so that you are declaring at least five (5) objects from your class.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>Instantiate your objects so that the constructor method has the correct number and
					    type of values being passed into the constructor between the parentheses.&nbsp; Once again,
						refer to the way this was done in Lab4. <br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>The <code>System.out.println</code> or <code>muta.println</code> statements used in Lab4 must be modified to use your objects
					    and to print messages that make sense for your class.&nbsp; For instance, if your class is
						<code>Airplane</code>, change the data printed with the <code>println</code> statements so that 
						the output makes sense for Airplane objects.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>Use the numeric properties of your objects to perform some kind of calculation.&nbsp;
					    For instance, if you had a <code>BaseballPlayer</code> class, you could add up the hits for all
						players who play for the same team and print the total.&nbsp; Use the "getter" methods of your 
						class to retrieve
						data from the numeric properties so that those values can be used in a calculation.&nbsp;
					        Use the <em><strong>setter</strong></em> to set initially and update values to be used throughout your
						program.
						Print the calculated value using <code>System.out.println</code>
						or <code>muta.println</code>, whichever you prefer.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>Test your program, and fix & retest as needed.<br /><br />
				    </li>
			    </ol>
			</li>

 <h3> Turning in your Program for Grading: </h3>
<blockquote>
  When you have completed your NetBeans project for PA2 (including the comment header at
  the top of the two files with your name and having your name appear in the title of the frame window, etc.), use 
  File Explorer to make a
  .zip file of the <b>PA2</b> folder in your
<b>CSC120\Java</b> folder so that the file is named <b>PA2.zip</b>.&nbsp; Next, run your program and obtain a screen
capture that shows the output generated by your program.&nbsp; Then upload
those two files to the PA2 dropbox in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank">D2L</a>.
