  </head>
  <body>
  
  <h2>Accessing the CS Lab Virtual Desktop with your web browser</h2>
  
  <h3> The CS Lab Virtual Desktop is a web-based interface that allows you to run all of the programs that are installed in our Lab image using a web browser.&nbsp; You can use this interface to work in the browser as if you were working with an actual computer.&nbsp;  All of the software you need for the course can be accessed from the Lab image.<br/><br/>
  
  Here are steps to follow to launch the CS Virtual Desktop:</h3>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
  <ol>
  
    <li>Click this link to the <a href="https://viewconnect.campus.muc.prv/portal/webclient/index.html#/" target="_blank"> VMWare Horizon login page</a>.&nbsp; Enter your username and password, make sure the pull-down box says "CAMPUS", and click <b>Login</b>. <br/><br/>

	<br /><br />
    </li>
    
    <li>A selection of choices will appear for different lab configurations.&nbsp; As of August 21, 2020, the Computer Science image for the current year is not yet working (it is named <em>D) Computer Science - Test</em>).&nbsp; So until further notice, you may choose the option titled <b>D) Computer Science</b>.  This is functional, and will be usable for coursework in CSC 120 at the start of the semester.&nbsp;  As soon as the image for this year is working, this page will be updated and your instructor will inform you via announcement. <br/><br/>

	<br /><br />
    </li>
    
    <li>The image will load in the browser window, and you will see a typical Windows startup screen (blue background, spinning icon).&nbsp; After a few moments, the virtual desktop image will appear in your browser window.&nbsp; It looks like the desktop of a Windows computer. <br/><br/>

    </li>
    
    <li>You can click the Start button at the bottom left of the virtual desktop to launch programs, such as NetBeans as shown here: <br/><br/>
