<hr/>
<ol>
    <li> Create a new NetBeans Java Application project named <em>LAB4</em> in your
         <b>CSC120</b> folder.&nbsp; Right-click on the following file and save it
		 in the <b>src</b> folder of your new project. <br/><br/>

         <ul>
              <li> <a href="ClothingItem.java"> ClothingItem.java</a> </li>
         </ul>
         <br/>

         Open this file in NetBeans and look at the code.&nbsp; This class has a constructor method (as all 
		 classes must have), along with a <code>toString</code> method.&nbsp; Also, notice that there are 
		 "getter" and "setter" methods for each of the private properties of the class, and notice the
		 different data types of the private data members &ndash; <code>name</code> and <code>type</code>
		 are <code><b>String</b></code> objects, while <code>price</code> is a <code><b>Double</b></code>
		 variable and <code>quantity</code> is an <code><b>Integer</b></code>. <br/><br/> </li>

    <li> Let's look at a main program that declares, instantiates and uses methods from the 
	     <code>ClothingItem</code> class.&nbsp; Right-click on the following file and save it
		 in the <b>src</b> folder of your new project. <br/><br/>

         <ul>
              <li> <a href="MUPanel.java"> MUPanel.java</a> </li>
         </ul>
         <br/>

         Open this file in NetBeans, and edit the comment header at the top of the file so that your name
		 replaces "Sammy Student".&nbsp; Also modify the "setName" method in the MUPanel constructor method
		 to use your name instead of Sammy's.&nbsp; Notice that we declare six (6) <code>ClothingItem</code> objects
		 at the top of the class definition.&nbsp; In the <code>MUPanel</code> constructor, we instantiate
		 the six objects and then call a method named <code>workWithClothingItems</code> -- this method 
		 must be defined later in our class definition.&nbsp; The <code>paintComponent</code> just draws a
		 string that tells the user to look in the Java Console for the results of the program.&nbsp; Run
		 the program now and look at the results below the editor window in your NetBeans IDE.<br/><br/> 

         All the work in this program is being done in the <code>workWithClothingItems</code> method.&nbsp; 
		 Notice that there are a series of <code>System.out.println</code> statements in this method &mdash;
		 each time one of these statements is executed, a line of output is printed in the Java Console.&nbsp;
		 See if you can determine why each <code>System.out.println</code> statement produces 
		 its corresponding line of output in the Java Console.&nbsp; Ask your instructor for an explanation
		 if you cannot figure out how the output is produced by this code.<br/><br/> </li>

    <li> A nagging little problem in Java arises when we want to use <code>Double</code> numeric values to represent 
	     currency amounts (dollars and cents).&nbsp; By default, Java programs print only as many decimal places 
		 as are needed to represent the actual value, so if you take a close look at the output of the program
		 you just ran, you'll notice that several of the prices are printed with only 1 digit to the right of the
		 decimal point.&nbsp; To force Java to print currency values with two decimal places every time to represent
		 cents, and automatically round long decimals to two decimal places, we can use a technique that involves 
		 the <code>NumberFormat</code> class.&nbsp; To see how this works,
		 copy the following line and paste it into the <b>ClothingItem.java</b> file as the new first line in the
		 <code>toString</code> method:
<pre>
    DecimalFormat currency = new DecimalFormat("#.00");
</pre>
         Netbeans will underline "DecimalFormat" as if it is an error, but to fix that, click the light-bulb icon
		 in the left margin of the line and choose "Add import for java.text.DecimalFormat".&nbsp;  Then, to use
		 this new format, change the end of the assignment statement in the <code>toString</code> method to be:
<pre>
    + " at a price of $" + currency.format(price);
</pre>		 
         Run the program now and you should see trailing zeros in the dollar amounts that are printed by the
		 <code>toString</code> method.<br/><br/>
		 
		 This technique was used in the <code>workWithClothingItems</code> method of the
		 <b>MUPanel.java</b> file &mdash; can you find the two places in that method that use the
		 <code>currency.format(...)</code> notation to print value that represent price data?&nbsp; 
		 Ask your instructor for help if you can't
		 figure out all the places where <code>currency.format(...)</code> is called.
		 <br/><br/> </li>

    <li> Right-click on the <b>src</b> folder of your project in the NetBeans file tree in the upper-left
         panel of the IDE, and choose "New | Java Class" to create a new class file in your project &ndash;
		 use the name <b>Coffee</b> for this new class file.<br/><br/> </li>

    <li> Each <code>Coffee</code> object will have three properties:&nbsp; <b>size</b> which is a 
	     <code>String</code>, <b>ounces</b> which is an <code>Integer</code>, and <b>price</b> which is a 
         <code>Double</code>.&nbsp; Declare these three properties in the correct location in the
		 <b>Coffee</b> class definition.&nbsp; Refer to the <b>ClothingItem</b> class definition for 
		 an example of declarations. <br/><br/> </li>

    <li> The constructor method of the <code>Coffee</code> class should accept three parameter values of the
	     appropriate types, and store the parameter values in the properties of the class.&nbsp;
		 Refer to the <b>ClothingItem</b> class definition for 
		 an example of writing a constructor method. <br/><br/> </li>

    <li> Write three "getter" methods in the <code>Coffee</code> class, one for each of the private data
	     members of the class.&nbsp; "Getter" methods do not accept any parameters, and return a value
		 that is the matching data type of the property.&nbsp;
		 Refer to the <b>ClothingItem</b> class definition for 
		 examples of how to write "getter" methods. <br/><br/> </li>

    <li> Write three "setter" methods in the <code>Coffee</code> class, one for each of the private data
	     members of the class.&nbsp; "Setter" methods accept one parameter of the same data type as the
		 matching property, and return nothing (that means the return type of a "setter" method
		 is <code>void</code>).&nbsp;
		 Refer to the <b>ClothingItem</b> class definition for 
		 examples of "setter" methods. <br/><br/> </li>
		 
    <li> Write a method named "calculatePricePerOunce" in the <code>Coffee</code> class.&nbsp; This method 
         returns a <code>Double</code> value and accepts no parameters.&nbsp; The answer calculated and 
         returned by this method should use the <code>price</code> and <code>ounces</code> properties to
		 be the price per ounce for this <code>Coffee</code> object.&nbsp; Refer to the "calculateTotalSpent"
		 method of the <code>ClothingItem</code> class for an example of how to write a method that calculates
		 an answer using properties of the object. <br/><br/> </li>

    <li> Write a <b><code>toString</code></b> method for the <code>Coffee</code> class.&nbsp; A 
	     <code>toString</code> method does not accept any parameters, and returns a <code>String</code> value
		 that is the concatenation of all of the data items in the class, with explanatory <code>String</code>
		 literal values in quotes between the data items.&nbsp;
		 Refer to the <b>ClothingItem</b> class definition for 
		 an example of a <code>toString</code> method.&nbsp; The result of your <code>toString</code>
		 method should look like this (the red text represents the values of the properties (private data
		 members) of
		 the object:
<pre>
        a Coffee object with size = <font color="#cc0000"><b>Grande</b></font> (<font color="#cc0000"><b>16</b></font> oz.) and price = $<font color="#cc0000"><b>7.00</b></font>
</pre>
         Be sure to use the <code>currency.format(...)</code> technique when printing the price so that monetary
		 amounts are always displayed with two decimal places to the right of the decimal point, as seen in step
		 3 of these lab directions. <br/><br/>
		 </li>

    <li> In the <b><code>MUPanel.java</code></b> file, declare 5 <code>Coffee</code> objects, using the names
	     <code>cup1</code>, <code>cup2</code>, up to <code>cup5</code>.&nbsp; In the <code>MUPanel</code>
		 constructor method, instantiate these objects using the following data: <br/>

    } // end of workWithCoffeeObjects
</pre>	
         <br/> </li>
	 
    <li> Insert a statement as the new last statement in the <code>MUPanel</code> constructor that calls the
	     <code>workWithCoffeeObjects</code> method.&nbsp; It's the same as the 
		 "workWithClothingItems" method call
		 that's currently the last statement in the constructor.&nbsp; The <code>workWithCoffeeObjects</code>
		 method accepts no parameters.
		 <br/><br/>
		 
         Run the program and examine the first 9 lines of output &ndash; the sixth through ninth lines 
		 of output should have
	     the correct information for the difference of the prices and ounces for the various sizes of
		 coffees and the prices per ounce. <br/><br/> </li>
		 
    <li> <code>System.out.println</code> works well for displaying lines of text in the Java Console, but
	     an inconvenient thing about the statement is the small size of the Java Console and the need to
		 scroll up and down to see output that consists of more than a few lines.&nbsp; It would be convenient
		 to have a way to display lines of text in the Graphical Output window.&nbsp; Later in the semester, 
		 we'll learn techniques for doing that, but at this point, we've written code to allow you to
		 add an object called a <code><b>MUTextArea</b></code> that works the same way System.out works,
		 but displays the text in the Graphical Output window.
		 <br/><br/>
		 
         Find the line in the MUPanel constructor method that says 
		 "<code>setPreferredSize(new Dimension(250,100));</code>" and change the numbers so that the
		 preferred size is 800 x 600.&nbsp; Next, right-click on the following file and save it
		 in the <b>src</b> folder of your project. <br/><br/>

         <ul>
              <li> <a href="MUTextArea.java"> MUTextArea.java</a> </li>
         </ul>
         <br/>

         Copy the following line and paste it into the <b>MUPanel.java</b> file in the private declarations
		 section of the file:
<pre>
    private MUTextArea muta;
</pre>
         Then copy the following lines and paste them into the <b>MUPanel.java</b> constructor method right after the line that
		 sets the background color to WHITE:
<pre>
        muta = new MUTextArea();
        muta.setBounds(10, 10, 780, 580);
        add(muta);
</pre>
        Whew!&nbsp; Now we're ready to change EVERY <code>System.out.println</code> statement in the program 
		to a <code>muta.println</code> statement.&nbsp; Instead of a lot of typing, we can use the "Replace"
		feature of the "Edit" menu to change all the lines at once.&nbsp; Choose &nbsp; 
		<b>Edit | Replace...</b> &nbsp; 
		from the NetBeans top menu, and in the dialog box that appears, fill in the "Find What:" field with
		<b>System.out</b>, fill in the "Replace With:" field with <b>muta</b>, and click the "Replace All"
		button.&nbsp; Here's a screenshot of what this looks like: <br/><br/>
		<img src="Lab4Dialog.png"><br/><br/>
		
		Now run the program and observe that the output is now displayed in a TextArea on the screen.&nbsp; Much
		more convenient than the Java Console, no?
		 <br/><br/> </li>
		 
 
    <li> After the comment in the <code>workWithCoffeeObjects</code> method, insert code that will set
	     the prices of <code>cup1</code> and <code>cup5</code> to be 25% of what they were.&nbsp; To do this, call
		 <code>setPrice</code> and <code>getPrice</code> for each of the objects, and use the proper
		 calculation to determine what is 25% of the old price.&nbsp; See the <code>workWithClothingItems</code>
		 method for an example of how to do this.&nbsp; DON'T DO THE MATH IN YOUR HEAD -- make the computer
		 carry out the calculation by using arithmetic operators in Java.<br/><br/> 
		 
		 When you run the program now, the last 5 lines output should show prices that are 25% of their
		 original values for <code>cup1</code> and <code>cup5</code>, with the others being the same as
		 they were originally.<br/><br/> </li>
		 
	<li> Run your program and obtain a screen capture of the window that includes the title in the frame that
    	 shows your name, and save the capure as a .png file.<br/><br/> </li>

		 
    <li> Using Windows Explorer, browse to your <b>CSC120</b> folder, right-click on the <b>Lab4</b> folder, choose
	     "Send to | Compressed (zipped) folder", and make sure the name of the zip file is <b>Lab4.zip</b>. <br/><br/> </li>

		 
    <li> Submit the .zip file and the screen capture .png file to the Lab4 dropbox in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu/" target="_blank">D2L</a>. <br/><br/> </li>
