		<h4> This assignment must be handed in to the PA4 dropbox in D2L <b>before</b>
			    the due date/time. </h4>

        <h3> Overview:</h3>
		<blockquote>
    		Using the class definition you developed for Programming Assignment 2, create a Java 
			application that provides a Graphical User Interface that allows the user to enter
			data values in TextFields for each property of the class, and displays output as described
			in these instructions in a scrollable TextArea.
		</blockquote>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>	
		<h3> Note:&nbsp; It is expected that each student will complete this
assignment INDIVIDUALLY. </h3>
        	
		<ol>
			<li>Initial Set-up.<br /><br />
			
			    <ol type="a">
			        <li>Create a NetBeans Java Application named PA4 in your network space.&nbsp;
						It should contain the class named <b>MUFrame</b> from the starter template we've used
						previously.&nbsp; Start with the files named <b>MUFrame.form</b> and <b>MUFrame.java</b> stored
						in the <b>MUFrameWithGUIDesigner.zip</b> file
						that is available in the "Starter Templates" section of the CSC 120 Student Resources page of the 
						course web site.&nbsp; You <b>won't</b> need to use the
						MUPanel.java file for this assignment.<br /><br />
					</li>
			        <li>Copy the <b>.java</b> file for the class you wrote for PA2 into the <b>src</b> folder of the PA4 project.<br /><br />
			        </li>
			        <li>Open the <b>MUFrame.java</b> file in the NetBeans editor, switch to "Source" view, and delete the three lines that refer
					    to  an object named <code><b>muPanel</b></code>.&nbsp; After doing this, you should be able to 
						run the <b>MUFrame.java</b> without errors an obtain a blank output screen.<br /><br />
			        </li>
			    </ol>
			</li>
			
			<li>Ensure that your class from PA2 has all required parts.<br /><br />
			    <ol type="a">
				    <li> Your class must have at least 4 properties, at least 2 of which are a numeric type (either Integer or Double).&nbsp;
					     The class must have a constructor method that stores initial values in the properties of
						 the object.&nbsp; The class must have a "getter" method for each property, and the class must have
						 a <code>toString</code> method that returns a String that shows all the property values.<br /> <br />
					</li>
				    <li> If your class doesn't satisfy all these requirements, fix it so that it does satisfy the requirements.
					     &nbsp;Failing to do this will result in point deductions for PA4. <br /> <br />
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
	    
			<li>Create your User Interface.<br /><br />
			
			    <ol type="a">
			        <li>Switch to "Design" view for the <b>MUFrame.java</b> file in NetBeans, and create a User
					    Interface for your program that
					    has a TextField for each of the properties in the class you wrote for PA2.&nbsp; Each
						of the fields should be preceded by a Label that describes what the user should enter
						into each field.<br /><br />
			        </li>
				    <li>Add two Buttons to the interface that will allow the user to click and display results
					    as described later in these instructions.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>Add a TextArea to the interface.&nbsp; This will be used for program output display.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>Be sure to "Edit Text" for each of the TextFields so that they are blank to start with,
					    and "Edit Text" for each of the Labels so that they display 
					    appropriate messages to the user indicating what should be entered into each of
						the TextFields.&nbsp; Also, "Edit Text" on the Buttons so that one of them displays a message 
						saying "Process Form Data" or something like that, and the other Button's message should
						be something like "Display Numeric Statistics".<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>Also be sure to "Change Variable Name" for all of the TextFields, the Buttons and the
					    TextArea so that they use names that are meaningful to your program topic.&nbsp;
						As an example, if your class has properties
					    named <code>albumName</code> and <code>tracksOnCD</code>, then your should name
						your TextFields <code>albumNameField</code> and <code>tracksOnCDField</code>.<br /><br />
				    </li>
			    </ol>
			</li>
	    
			<li>Code the <b>actionPerformed</b> method for the "Process Form Data" Button.<br /><br />
			
			    <ol type="a">
				    <li>Double-click on the Button that will process the form data in your User Interface 
					    to  make NetBeans insert an <b>
 					    actionPerformed</b> method into the <b>MUFrame</b> class.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>When the user clicks on this Button, your application should do the following in this order:<br/>&nbsp;
    					<ol type="i"> 
						  <li> retrieve all data from the TextFields into String objects </li>
						  <li> instantiate a new object from your class (you will need to convert some input data into Integer and/or Double data types)</li>
						  <li> display the results of the <code><b>toString</b></code> method called for the new object in the TextArea of the User Interface</li>
						  <li> call the "getter" method of the new object for one of the numeric properties in your class, and add the value retrieved 
						       to a "total" variable of the proper data type.</li>
						  <!--li> compare the value retrieved in the previous step with a maximum and a minimum
						       variable of the proper type.&nbsp; If the value retrieved from the "getter" method is 
						       larger than the maximum variable, it should be stored as the new value of the maximum
						       variable.&nbsp; If the value retrieved from the "getter" is smaller than the minimum variable,
						       it should be stored as the new minimum.-->
						  <li> add one to a "count" variable that will keep track of how many times the "Process Form Data" button has been
						       clicked.&nbsp; This will be needed to calculate the average value described below.</li>
						 </ol>  <br/>
				    </li>
				    <li>The messages appended to the TextArea should be displayed on separate lines, with a blank line
					     between the output generated by successive button clicks.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>Of course your program will have to use <code>Integer.parseInt</code> and/or 
					    <code>Double.parseDouble</code> to convert the <code>String</code> data from the TextFields for 
						the numeric properties of your object into the proper numeric type before instantiating your 
						object.<br /><br />
				    </li>
			    </ol>
			</li>
	    
			<li>Code the <b>actionPerformed</b> method for the "Display Numeric Statistics" Button.<br /><br />
			
			    <ol type="a">
				    <li>Double-click on the other Button in your Interface  
					    to  make NetBeans insert another <b>
 					    actionPerformed</b> method into the <b>MUFrame</b> class.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>When the user clicks on this Button, your application should calculate the average value of the numeric field
					    you've chosen to use, and then display the total and average values that the user has entered for the numeric field.<br /><br />
				    </li>
					<li>The average must be displayed with decimal places, even if the field you are averaging is an Integer field.&nbsp; The average
					    must be computed as a Double value, and show the exact average, not truncated to an Integer value.<br/><br/>
					</li>
				    <li>Display a blank line
					     between the output generated by successive button clicks.<br /><br />
				    </li>
			    </ol>
			</li>
	    
			<li><em>Optional:&nbsp;</em> Keep track of statistics for two or more properties of your class, if you would like.<br /><br />
			
			    <ol type="a">
				    <li>If it makes sense for your topic, you can separately keep track of the "total" for each
					    of your class' numeric properties.&nbsp; Just be sure not to mix them up.<br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li>When the user clicks on the Button that displays the statistics, be sure to clearly
					    indicate in the output which property's statistics are being displayed on each line. <br /><br />
				    </li>
				    <li> You are not required to keep the total for more than one of your numeric properties for this assignment; you can do 
					    that if you choose.&nbsp; The requirements are to keep the total for at least one of the numeric properties of your class.
				    </li>
			    </ol>
			</li>

<h3> Turning in your Program for Grading: </h3>
<blockquote>
  Convert your
<b>CSC120\PA4</b> folder into a .zip file named <code><b>PA4.zip</b></code> and obtain a screen capture of your program after entering several sets of data and then clicking the "Display Numeric Statistics" button.&nbsp; Then submit both files to the PA4 dropbox
in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank"> D2L</a>.&nbsp 
<br><br><em>Note, for Dr. Huibregtse's section the folder name is PA4-LastName so zip and submit that will all project and images files included.</em>
