<h4> This assignment must be submitted to the PA3 D2L dropbox <b>before</b> the beginning of class on the due date.</h4>

<h3>Overview:</h3>

<blockquote>Develop a Java Application program that displays at least three visual objects
 in the MUPanel that are changed when the user clicks 
a button in the program interface.&nbsp; The objects must be displayed on a background that can be changed
somehow when another button is clicked.&nbsp; There must be at least two different effects that are
caused when specific buttons are clicked, meaning that there must be at least
two buttons in the user interface of the program.&nbsp; Other buttons
may be used to control various properties of the objects' movements or changes,
such as distance to move, etc.
</blockquote>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Create an application called <b>PA3.</b> It should contain two classes named <b>MUFrame</b> and 
	<b>MUPanel</b>.&nbsp; Start with the three files located in the <b>MUFrameWithGUIDesigner.zip</b> file
	that is available in the "Starter Templates" section of the <a href="https://sjhuibregtse.github.io/20F-csc120/resources.html" target="_blank"> 
	    CSC 120 Student Resources page</a> of the course web site.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>Create two more classes for objects that can be drawn in the MUPanel.
        One class will be a <b>Background</b> class, and draw a background for the scene.
        The other class is for objects that will be drawn on top of the background object.
        Both classes will have methods for changing the objects in some way. The background
        might change back and forth from day to night with clouds and sun or stars and moon,
        or rain &amp; snow or whatever. The other objects might change colors, change shapes,
        move up and down, move sideways, grow, shrink, etc.
        You may not use the RoundHead class or any other class that has already been used
        in a lab or a class that already exists. However, you may use one or more of the objects that you
		created for PA1. Also, your objects must be more detailed than a simple
        circle or oval or square that can be drawn with only one or two method calls from the
        Graphics class.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>The MUPanel class must declare and instantiate one Background object,
        and at least 3 objects from your other class,
        and the paintComponent method of the MUPanel must call the draw methods of
        the background object and the other objects.&nbsp; In addition, the MUPanel class
		needs to have methods that can change the background and other objects in some
		way (these "change" methods will be called from MUFrame when the buttons in 
		the application are clicked by the user).<br /><br />
    </li>
  
    <li>Using the GUI Designer, add <b>at least</b> two Buttons to the MUFrame. At least one button must
        call a method in MUPanel that changes the appearance of the Background 
		object. At least one button must call a method in MUPanel that changes all 
		of the objects
        from the other class to move them or change their appearance.
        Of course these Buttons will need to have the proper code in their "actionPerformed"
		methods, and call <code>muPanel.repaint();</code> at the end of the method as in Lab 6 and class demos.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>Enhancements are optional, but make your classes interesting and different from
        ones used by other people. Perhaps the Background could draw a room with stuff on the floor
        and walls, and maybe a light on the ceiling, and the other class could be a Furniture class.
        Or the background could be a city with streets, and the other class could be people or
        cars. Or a house & yard with Flowers (oh, wait we've
        done that already). Hmmmm, the jungle and animals, or ... Be creative!<br /><br />
		
		Something interesting you might want to explore would be displaying a JPG, GIF or PNG image as part of the objects
		in your scene, either as the background for your application or for the objects to be drawn on the background.&nbsp;
		Consult the <a href="../howDoI/ImageWithFrame/index.html" target="_blank"> ImageWithFrame Demo</a> for an example of how to do this.<br /><br />
    </li>
    
    <li>Don't forget your comment header for MUPanel, and put a comment header in each of the
        other class files.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>As usual, when you have completed your NetBeans project for PA3 (including the comment header at
  the top of the four files with your name, etc.), use File Explorer to make a
  .zip file of the <b>PA3</b> folder in your
<b>CSC120\Java</b> folder so that the file is named <b>PA3.zip</b>.&nbsp; Next, run the program and
  obtain a screen capture of the output window that shows your name in the title of the window frame.&nbsp;
  Then upload
those files to the PA3 dropbox in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank">D2L</a>.<br /><br />
    </li>
</ol>
